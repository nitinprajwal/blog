{"id":"rectm71RvJl67eCZD","createdTime":"2025-05-22T16:17:11.000Z","sourceHeadline":"Crypto for Advisors: When Crypto Meets Netflix","sourceSummary":"The article \"Crypto for Advisors: When Crypto Meets Netflix\" explores the intersection of cryptocurrency, blockchain technology, and the entertainment industry, particularly focusing on the popular series Black Mirror. \n\nBlack Mirror's interactive episode Bandersnatch marked a shift towards more immersive storytelling. Now, the series is leveraging blockchain to create a more engaging experience. Banijay Rights, the global sales arm of Black Mirror's distributor, partnered with Pixelynx Inc. and KOR Protocol to bring the Black Mirror universe on-chain.\n\nThis initiative includes a token inspired by the Nosedive episode, allowing fans to link their social media and wallets to earn a reputation score. Top participants can unlock exclusive experiences and rewards. This approach enables on-chain IP verification, composable rights, community ownership, and tokenized incentives for creators and fans.\n\nThe article argues that traditional intellectual property (IP) revenue models are evolving due to generative AI. Blockchain technology offers a solution by providing a secure, transparent, and interactive way to engage with fans. This new model allows IP holders to protect and expand their narrative while rewarding their most passionate fans.\n\nThe author, Shivani Phull, concludes that this marks the beginning of Storytelling 3.0, where fans are stakeholders shaping narratives with their favorite IPs, not just spectators. Eric Tomaszewski, a financial advisor, adds that this new model could act as a form of \"digital yield\" for younger investors, where engagement and credibility can earn tangible rewards.\n","socialChannels":["Blog"],"postImage":"https://www.coindesk.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn.sanity.io%2Fimages%2Fs3y3vcno%2Fproduction%2F60cfd442b18fa84574df4c1a10bcc7acec1bc47e-3840x2560.jpg%3Fauto%3Dformat&w=3840&q=75","Status":"Approved","sourceURL":"https://www.coindesk.com/coindesk-indices/2025/05/21/crypto-for-advisors-when-crypto-meets-netflix","Content":"[BTC$111,769.33+1.76%](/price/bitcoin

The passive, one-way consumption model that has defined entertainment for decades is increasingly out of sync with the expectations of digital-native audiences. And now, with the rise of new technologies, the entertainment intellectual property (IP) is entertainment intellectual property, or IP, is being fundamentally reimagined.\n\n### **From Bandersnatch to Blockchain**\n\n_Black Mirror_ has never been afraid to challenge the status quo. In 2018, the series broke new ground with _Bandersnatch_, an interactive episode. It hinted at a deeper shift: from stories we watch to stories we shape.\n\nThat shift is accelerating. Members of Gen Z and Gen Alpha have been raised in worlds like Minecraft, Roblox and Fortnite, where user-generated content forms the foundation of the experience. These audiences don’t want to passively consume; they want to participate, shape and own the narrative.\n\n### **Traditional IP Revenue Is Evolving**\n\nTraditionally, IP holders made money through licensing, syndication, product placement and box office sales. But generative AI is disrupting this model. With tools like OpenAI’s Sora or Runway, anyone can spin up derivative content, posing both a threat and an opportunity. For IP owners, the challenge is clear: either lose control of the narrative or lean into new models that protect and expand it.\n\nEnter blockchain.\n\n### **Blockchain as the Rails for Interactive IP**\n\nBlockchain brings the missing layer of structure. It allows for:\n\n* **On-chain IP verification** — using blockchain to prove who owns creative content, making it secure and transparent.\n* **Composable rights** — content can be broken down into smaller parts that others can build on, remix or combine with new creations, allowing for microlicensing.\n* **Community ownership and participation rewards** — fans can hold tokens that give them access to exclusive experiences and benefits as the project grows.\n* **Tokenized incentives for creators and fans** — digital tokens are used to reward people for contributing, collaborating or being active in the community.\n\nThis format unlocks new paths for storytelling, where fans are stakeholders shaping narratives with their favorite IPs, not just spectators.\n\n### **Case Study: Black Mirror Enters Web3**\n\nBanijay Rights, the global sales arm of content powerhouse Banijay Entertainment, which handles distribution for _Black Mirror_, has partnered with Pixelynx Inc. and KOR Protocol, a blockchain-based IP infrastructure and entertainment company based in Los Angeles, co-founded by iconic DJs Deadmau5 and Richie Hawtin. Led by visionary CEO Inder Phull, Pixelynx helped bring the _Black Mirror_ universe on-chain in a way that’s interactive, compliant and community-driven.\n\nTheir latest initiative is a token inspired by the _Nosedive_ episode, where fans link their socials and wallets to earn a reputation score. With more than 300,000 sign-ups, top participants unlock exclusive experiences and rewards, offering IP holders a new way to engage and reward their most passionate fans.\n\n![Black Mirror portal ](/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn.sanity.io%2Fimages%2Fs3y3vcno%2Fproduction%2Fff3183cadc575c95c5a2a851108593598b76b5a2-1600x908.png%3Fauto%3Dformat&w=3840&q=75)\n\n### **The IP Industry’s Fork in the Road**\n\nThe future of entertainment lies in embracing this shift through new frameworks that provide clear guardrails for IP usage, that preserve integrity, protect rights and enable value to accrue to fans and creators in a fair and transparent way. This marks the beginning of a new era for IP: one defined by protection, participation and sustainable monetization.\n\nBy making IPs interactive, tokenized and on-chain, rights holders aren’t just experimenting—they’re sketching the blueprint for Storytelling 3.0.\n\n**\\- [Shivani Phull, CFO, Pixelynx Inc.](https://www.coindesk.com/author/shivani-phull)**\n\n---\n\n### Ask an Expert\n\n**Q. What does \"ownership\" mean in the age of Web3, and how is it different from traditional investing?**\n\n**A.** Ownership in Web3 is not just about holding an asset. More so, it's about participating in a system. With the Black Mirror token, owning the token means having a say in governance, gaining access to exclusive ecosystems, and building a digital form of identity that has the ability to grow in value over time. Unlike passive stock ownership, this is participatory. You are a stakeholder, not just a shareholder.\n\n**Q. Can reputation-based tokens create economic value from behavior and is it sustainable?**\n\n**A.** Yes, but it's nuanced. Black Mirror token gamifies trust because your on-chain actions and social interactions can earn tangible rewards. As a financial advisor, I'd caution that while this is exciting, it introduces performance-based risk. That being said, it reflects the direction of where young digitally native investors are heading.\n\n**Q. Could these tokens act as a new form of \"digital yield\" for younger investors?**\n\n**A.** Absolutely. Instead of fixed income yield, this is engagement yield. The more active and credible you are, the more awards you could potentially earn. It could be whitelisting access, platform discounts, or possibly token-based income. This is a new incentive model in some respects.\n\nWhen speaking to a client, I frame it as a form of behavioral finance in motion. With the right level of risk and time allocation, it becomes an asset that pays in influence and access. It's also a way to acknowledge that fulfillment and value look different to each person. Not every return is financial.\n\n\\- [**Eric Tomaszewski, financial advisor, Verde Capital Management**](https://www.linkedin.com/in/eric-tomaszewski-9278513/)\n\n---\n\n### Keep Reading\n\n* JP Morgan to enable clients to [invest in bitcoin](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/05/19/jpmorgan-ceo-jamie-dimon-says-the-bank-will-let-clients-buy-bitcoin.html).\n* [Robinhood](https://www.reuters.com/business/finance/robinhood-woos-canadian-crypto-users-with-nearly-180-million-wonderfi-purchase-2025-05-13/) to acquire Canadian crypto firm Wonderfi.\n* The U.S. Senate voted 66-32 to advance its landmark [stablecoin legislation](https://x.com/CoinDesk/status/1924638812761731511?t=nz5ukqPAl3x3Yvg5CeBmyQ&s=09), the GENIUS Act.\n* [Digital Assets: Month in Review](https://etfexpress.com/2025/05/16/global-digital-assets-april-2025-in-review/), with Joshua de Vos of CoinDesk delivering a monthly column on the crypto markets and ETF/ETP flows.\n\n[Web3](/tag/web3)[Black Mirror](/tag/black-mirror)[Gen Z](/tag/gen-z)[Generation Z](/tag/generation-z)[Crypto for Advisors](/tag/crypto-for-advisors)[CoinDesk Indices](/tag/coindesk-indices)\n\n##### [Shivani Phull](/author/shivani-phull)\n\nStrategic finance and operations leader with experience across the U.S., UK, and UAE, focused on venture capital, M&A, and scaling high-growth companies.
