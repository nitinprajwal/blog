# GitHub Copilot Gains Agent Capabilities to Automate DevOps Workflows

During the recent Microsoft Build conference, GitHub announced a significant expansion of its AI-powered coding assistant, Copilot. The platform is set to receive advanced agent capabilities aimed at automating key aspects of the DevOps cycle.

## Introducing the Agentic DevOps Loop

This enhancement signifies a shift in how developers can interact with AI tools. The new functionality allows GitHub Copilot to take on a more proactive role, effectively "taking the wheel" when specific coding or development tasks are required. This is facilitated by the introduction of a novel asynchronous coding agent.

This powerful agent is being deeply embedded directly within the GitHub platform itself. Furthermore, developers will be able to interact with and utilize this agent through a conversational interface directly from within their VS Code integrated development environment (IDE).

The primary goal behind integrating these agent capabilities is to forge what GitHub describes as a "powerful Agentic DevOps loop." This innovative approach is designed to streamline and automate various processes, ultimately enhancing the efficiency and productivity of developers throughout their coding and deployment workflows.
